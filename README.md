EchoMind is a Chrome extension that allows you to record audio from any webpage, transcribe it using Groq's blazing-fast implementation of the Whisper model, and then process the transcribed text using powerful LLMs hosted by Cerebras or Google. It's your personal AI assistant for the web!

## Features

*   **Tab Audio Recording:** Capture audio directly from your active browser tab. No need for external recording software.
*   **Fast Transcription:** Leverage Groq's incredibly fast implementation of OpenAI's [Whisper-large-v3-turbo](https://console.groq.com/docs/models) model for accurate and speedy speech-to-text conversion.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Transcribe audio in multiple languages, including Chinese (zh), English (en), Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Japanese (ja), Korean (ko), and Russian (ru). Automatic language detection is also supported.
*   **AI-Powered Processing:** Process the transcribed text using:
    *   Meta's [llama-3.3-70b](https://inference-docs.cerebras.ai/introduction) (hosted by Cerebras)

* **AI-Processing Options:**
    *   **Summarization:** Get concise summaries of lengthy audio content.
    *   **Question Answering:** Ask questions about the audio and receive AI-generated answers.
